      <p>The original web, as conceived by Tim Berners-Lee, is almost dead.</p>
      <p>There’s <em>just enough</em> of it left so that we can fool ourselves into believing otherwise.</p>
      <p>But maybe we shouldn’t mourn the dying web, maybe we should <em>build something better</em> instead.</p>
      <p>What would that look like? It had to be a true internet of people. Something where everyone could say: <em>we are the net</em>.</p>
